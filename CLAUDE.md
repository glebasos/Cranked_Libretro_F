# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

A Windows/MSVC port of **Cranked** (a Playdate console emulator, originally by TheLogicMaster) focused on its **libretro core** for RetroArch, plus the SDL2/ImGui **desktop app** with debugging views. Lua games run well: graphics, text, sprites, file APIs, and sample/file-player audio all work. Native (ARM/pdex.bin) games use unicorn emulation and are less tested. Synth/instrument/sequence audio sources are still silent stubs.

## Building (Windows/MSVC)

One-time setup from a fresh clone: `scripts\setup_windows.bat` — fetches submodules (must use `--checkout --force`; the `update = merge` in .gitmodules breaks shallow fetches), clones standalone asio into `core/libs/asio_standalone`, and applies the `patches/*.patch` files to the `ffi`, `unicorn`, and `lua54` submodules. **The submodule patches are not committed inside the submodules** — after any submodule re-checkout, re-apply them or the build breaks (link collision on `crc32`, MASM failures in libffi).

Then, from a VS x64 developer environment (vcvars64):

```bat
:: Stage zlib once (libzip does find_package(ZLIB); there is no system zlib on Windows)
cmake -S core/libs/zlib -B <deps>/build-zlib -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<deps>/zlib
cmake --build <deps>/build-zlib --target install

:: Configure + build the libretro core (RelWithDebInfo keeps PDBs for the crash handler's stack traces)
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo -DSKIP_TESTING=ON -DSKIP_JAVA=ON -DSKIP_DESKTOP=ON -DUSE_CAPSTONE=OFF -DZLIB_ROOT=<deps>/zlib -DZLIB_USE_STATIC_LIBS=ON -DUNICORN_ARCH=arm -DCMAKE_POLICY_VERSION_MINIMUM=3.5
cmake --build build --target cranked_libretro    :: -> build/libretro/cranked_libretro.dll
```

Desktop app: add `-DSKIP_DESKTOP=OFF -DSDL2_DIR=<SDL2-devel-VC>/cmake`, target `cranked_desktop`, and put `SDL2.dll` next to the exe. It takes a `.pdx` directory as its argument (not zips). Keys: arrows = d-pad, **A = Playdate B**, **S = Playdate A**. It writes `imgui.ini` and `appData/` (game saves) into its working directory.

## Testing changes against real games

The core loads `.pdx` directories and `.pdx.zip` (extracts to %TEMP%, auto-cleans). Headless verification loop with RetroArch:

```
retroarch -L cranked_libretro.dll game.pdx --max-frames=300 --max-frames-ss --max-frames-ss-path=shot.png
```

Gotchas learned the hard way:
- **RetroArch pauses when unfocused** — headless runs freeze after one frame unless `pause_nonactive = "false"` is set (use `--appendconfig`).
- `log_cb` output needs `--verbose --log-file`; core `fprintf(stderr, …)` always reaches the console.
- Keyboard in RetroArch: **X = Playdate B, Z = Playdate A** (RetroPad B→PD A, A→PD B in `libretro/core.cpp updateInputs`).
- Synthetic OS keypresses don't reach RetroArch, so input callbacks can't be exercised interactively in automated runs. Instead set `CRANKED_AUTOTEST=1`: the core presses A every 180 frames from 120 and spins the crank from frame 240 (see `updateInputs`). Use `CRANKED_AUTOTEST=2` to press A *without* the crank spin — the crank drives list selection in many games, so only the no-crank mode descends menus deterministically (this is how you reach smolitaire's Klondike table).

Debugging toolkit already wired in:
- `libretro/core.cpp` installs a vectored exception handler printing dbghelp-symbolized stack traces on access violations (works because builds are RelWithDebInfo).
- The lua54 patch makes `LUAI_TRY` print swallowed C++ exception messages (`LUAI_TRY native exception: …`) — otherwise Lua-boundary errors surface only as "Native exception" with no detail.
- The desktop app's main loop prints `Uncaught emulator error: …` for anything the emulator throws.
- To read a game's logic: unpack `.pdz` with the pdz tool from the playdate-reverse-engineering repo, then decompile `.luac` with scratchminer's unluac fork — output is near-perfect Lua.

## Architecture

- `core/Cranked.{hpp,cpp}` — top-level emulator object; frontends drive it via `update()`. Input edges (`pressedInputs`) are computed here from `currentInputs`, which frontends set each frame.
- Two execution engines: `LuaEngine`/`LuaRuntime` (patched Lua 5.4 running game bytecode + `core/resources/runtime.lua` CoreLibs shim) and `NativeEngine` (unicorn ARM emulation for `pdex.bin`, libffi for emulated→host calls). Games may use either or both.
- `Rom.cpp` parses all Playdate formats (pdz/pdi/pdt/pft/pda). System assets are embedded via `scripts/embed_resource.py` into `core/gen/*.hpp` at build time (needs Python).
- `core/gen/PlaydateAPI.hpp` + `PlaydateFunctionMappings.cpp` — generated C API bindings shared by both engines. `LuaRuntime.cpp` holds the Lua-side wrappers.
- `HeapAllocator` — one 4096-aligned block acting as the emulated heap; host↔virtual addresses translate at engine boundaries.
- `Audio` (`core/Audio.{hpp,cpp}`) — `Audio::sampleAudio` mixes `mainChannel` + `channels`; `playSampleAudio` implements SamplePlayer/FilePlayer playback. FilePlayer buffers whole files via `loadSample` (no streaming). The libretro core pumps 735 frames per 60fps video frame at 44100 Hz; the desktop app uses SDL queue-mode audio from the main thread. **Everything is single-threaded** — audio mixing mutates player state and must stay on the emulator thread.
- `libretro/core.cpp` — entire libretro port: content extraction, XRGB8888 framebuffer, input/crank mapping, core options, audio pump, crash handler.

## Semantics that are easy to get wrong (bugs fixed here; don't regress)

- `clearClipRect` resets the clip to **full bitmap bounds**; an empty rect silently discards all drawing (`drawPixel` tests `clipRect.contains`).
- Format magic checks are `strncmp` with ident length — file payloads follow the 12-byte magic with no NUL, so `strcmp` always mismatches (this made audio never load).
- `.pda` header: uint24 sample rate at offset 12, uint8 format at 15. ADPCM blocks start after a uint16 blockSize word; the per-block predictor is signed int16; step must be seeded from the header's stepIndex.
- Playback repeat semantics: 0 = loop forever, -1 = ping-pong, N = play N times. **Lua `play()` with no args means 1** — a nil→0 coercion loops forever, and games that poll `isPlaying()` then hang (this froze whole games on intro screens).
- Lua `playdate.file.*` APIs tolerate nil paths (device behavior); throwing kills the game's top-level script.
- `import` is include-once: a module must be registered as loaded **before** its body executes, so circular imports are no-ops (as on device) instead of infinite recursion.
- Lua callbacks (`invokeLuaCallback`/`invokeLuaInputCallback`) must use `lua_pcall`, never `lua_call` — an error in a game's input handler otherwise reaches the Lua panic handler and aborts the process.
- `setDitherPattern` semantics (implemented in `drawPixel`'s `DitherColor` case): black pixels on transparent — white pixels on transparent if the drawing color was **white** when set — and **alpha is inverted for both colors**: 1.0 = transparent, 0 = opaque (verified against RootBear on hardware: beer at 0.25 renders ~75% black, foam at 0.9 nearly white). Before this was implemented, dithered fills rendered solid black (RootBear's glass). `BayerTable<N>`'s formula is only valid for N=8; 2x2/4x4 use explicit matrices in `ditherThreshold`.
- **Lua 5.4 `lua_tointeger` returns 0 for floats with fractional parts** — `LuaVal::getIntField`/`getIntElement` and `getPolygonPoints` convert via `lua_tonumber` + cast. Before this fix, fractional polygon coords collapsed to 0 and RootBear's pour stream drew at the sprite's left edge instead of under the tap (CoreLibs `drawSineWave` → `transformPolygon` produces fractional coords).
- **Never register raw C-API `int32` predicates to Lua** — the wrapper pushes an integer and `0` is truthy in Lua. `isCrankDocked`, `getFlipped`, `getReduceFlashing`, `shouldDisplay24HourTime`, sprite `isVisible`/`updatesEnabled`/`collisionsEnabled`, and sound `isPlaying`/`didUnderrun` use `_lua` bool wrappers. Symptom: the "Use the crank!" indicator always visible, drawn flipped at top-left (`if playdate.getFlipped()` always true).
- `gfx.setFont` also accepts a font **path string** (undocumented device behavior; falls back to `asUserdataObject` for font objects) — RootBear's score jar relies on it.
- **`type()` must report "userdata" for playdate API objects** — on device images/sprites/sound players/geometry are full userdata, but this emulator wraps them in tables. runtime.lua overrides the global `type` to return "userdata" for tables whose metatable carries a `playdate.*` `__name`; CoreLibs class instances keep reporting "table" (their metatable is the class table, no own `__name`). Without this, smolitaire's recursive volume-setter descended into a sampleplayer table and indexed its raw `userdata` field, failing at load.
- `rect:offsetBy` must pass width/height through (was copy-pasted from `point:offsetBy` and returned a rect with nil size — crashed smolitaire's playout menu layout).
- **`pushContext(target)` must clear the context's inherited `focusedImage`.** `DisplayContext::getTargetBitmap()` prefers `focusedImage` over `bitmap`, and `pushContext` copy-constructs the current context — so a `pushContext(img)` *nested inside* a `lockFocus(bg)` kept drawing into `bg`. Symptom in smolitaire: the menu's playout tree rendered its text straight onto the background at the wrong origin (menu items sprawled over the "Smolitaire" title) instead of into its own sprite image, and the selection pointer had nothing to sit beside.
- **`sprite:update()` on an instance updates and draws ALL sprites** — on device `update` is a class function reached through the sprite metatable, and games (smolitaire's pointer, `spr:update()`) use it as their per-frame render call. But it must no-op when re-entered from inside a sprite's own update callback (a subclass doing `Foo.super.update(self)`), or the update-all recurses until the C stack blows (Crunky). `Graphics::inSpriteUpdateAll` guards this.
- **Optional Lua number args must be taken as `LuaVal`, never as a raw `float`/`int` parameter** — the wrapper coerces a missing arg via `lua_tonumber` and yields **0**, not the documented default. `sprite:setImage(img)` (one arg) was setting the sprite's scale to `{0,0}`; harmless only while the draw path ignored scale, then instantly fatal once it didn't (zero-determinant transform → NaN → invisible sprite). This is the same class of bug as the `int32`-predicate one below; audit any `_lua` wrapper whose trailing params are plain numerics.
- `LCDSprite_32::draw()` honors `rotation`/`scale` (via `rotateBitmap`) and the sprite's own `drawMode` (not the ambient context's). `Graphics::transformBitmap` returns an empty bitmap for a singular transform rather than inverting to NaN, and gives maskless sources a mask so the uncovered corners of a rotated image stay transparent instead of black.
- Smolitaire's in-game "card you're about to pick" indicator is a `sprite.new()` + later `setImage(getStackImage(...))` at zIndex 10 over a dithered shadow sprite at zIndex 9 — if the lifted card is missing but its shadow shows, suspect the sprite scale/draw path, not the dither code.
- MSVC silently ignores C++20 parenthesized aggregate initialization of array members in ctor init lists — it compiles and never evaluates the initializers (this shipped empty system fonts with zero errors). Grep `\[[0-9]\]{};` in headers and check those members' ctors if a subsystem is mysteriously default-initialized on Windows only.
- MSVC portability already handled in-tree: no `std::aligned_alloc`/`vasprintf`/`SIGTRAP`/`uint`; `fs::path` is wide — use `.string()`/`.generic_string()` (Playdate paths want forward slashes); `/Zc:__cplusplus /utf-8 /bigobj` are required globally; `FFI_BUILDING` must be defined for libffi consumers; standalone asio (`ASIO_STANDALONE`) replaces boost::asio (real headers at `asio_standalone/include`, not `asio/include` which is a symlink-as-file on Windows).

## Known gaps

Synth/instrument/sequence audio silent; FilePlayer doesn't stream (whole file buffered); no save states; Lua-side sound finish/loop callbacks not implemented; some native games show display artifacts; encrypted Catalog games unsupported.
